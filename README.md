## Enhanced Harvest Time Tracker ##
=============================

Adds list titles to head of item names for better tracking.

Our team uses a bunch of Todo lists - each Todo list is named after the client site or project, and each todo item is a standard task often repeated among various projects.  This enhanced version of the harvest time tracker extension  prepends the *Todo List Title* in front of the *Todo Item Title* creating more context for the description.
