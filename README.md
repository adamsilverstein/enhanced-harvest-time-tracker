enhanced-harvest-time-tracker
=============================

Adds list titles to head of item names for better tracking.

Our team uses a bunch of Todo lists - each Todo list is named after the client site or project, and each todo item is a standard task often repeated among various projects.  This enhanced version of the harvest time tracker extension  prepends the *Todo List Title* in front of the *Todo Item Title* creating more context for the description.

Installing the enhanced version of the extension:

 * Remove the existing harvest time tracker if already installed
 * Git pull the Enhanced Harvest Time Tracker - https://github.com/adamsilverstein/enhanced-harvest-time-tracker
 * Visit Chrome’s Extensions page: chrome://extensions/
 * Check ‘Developer mode’ in the upper right
 * To install: drag the extracted extension folder onto the Chrome Extensions page or click 'Load unpacked extension'
 * If you already ran the original Chrome extension you might need to restart your browser.

Reload a Basecamp page and click a clock icon!

*Upgrading to the latest version*
git pull
in extensions (chrome://extensions/) click 'reload' next to the extension
